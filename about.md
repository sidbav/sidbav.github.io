Hi! My name is Sidharth Baveja.

I am a 4th year Electrical Engineering student at the University of Waterloo.
My interests include Cryptocurrencies, Electric and Autonomous Vehicles, AI Investing and personal development.

In my free time you will probably find me looking at stock and [crypto](https://blockfi.com/?ref=552bdfc5) prices, reading a [book](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/126577647-sidharth-baveja), or watching some Youtube videos.

I am currently looking for Fall 2021 (Sept - Dec 2021) internship opportunities so feel free to email me at *sidharthbav [at] gmail [dot] com* if you got something in mind.
