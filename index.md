Welcome to my website! I created this site to write about topics that interest me, whether that be crypto, AI, Electric/Autonomous vehicles, or anything else.

I am currently looking for 2022 New Grad Opportunities, so if you have something in mind, feel free to send me an email at *sidharthbav [at] gmail [dot] com*.
