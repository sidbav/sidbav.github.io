Welcome to my website! I created this site to write about topics that interest me, whether that be crypto, AI, Electric/Autonomous vehicles, or anything else.

I recently created a blog called [Applying Machine Learning to CyberSecurity](https://ml-to-cs.sidharthbaveja.com/).

I am currently looking for New Grad 2024 Software Engineering Roles, check out my [**resume**]({{ site.url }}/assets/08072023_Sidharth_Baveja_Resume.pdf){:target="_blank"}, last updated **August 7th, 2023**.

If you think I would be a good fit on your team, or you just want to reach out to say Hi, feel free to send me an email at *sidharthbav [at] gmail [dot] com*.
