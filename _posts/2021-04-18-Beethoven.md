Beethoven. Regardless of if you are musically inclined or not, you have probably have heard of Beethoven's name.Here is a quick summary of Beethoven: Ludwig van Beethoven or better know simply as Beethoven was born in 1770 and died in 1827. He is a very well known German composer and pianist whose work is still admired about 200 years later. 

How is Beethoven musical work is still admired to this day, about 200 years after he composed his music? How did Beethoven achieve this? Nowadays, in the era of social media, a topic or a person is usually "trending" for a few days or at most a couple weeks. For example, not many people are thinking about the [Ever Given Blocking the Suez Canal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suez_Canal#2021_obstruction_by_Ever_Given) right now

Here is the Google Trends result for the [Ever Given](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2021-03-18%202021-04-18&q=ever%20given) for the last 30 days:

On the other hand, if we take a look at the Google Trends results for [Beethoven](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2021-03-18%202021-04-18&q=beethoven) it is much more consistent, hovering around the 50-75 range:

Why is Beethoven still relevant today? Although we cannot definitely say why Beethoven is relevant today we can speculate that the answer lays in Beethoven's ears.

Something that I left out in my "quick summary" of Beethoven is he began to lose his hearing during the 1800s and he became completely deaf in the 1820s. You would think that most composers would given up music in this case, but Beethoven did not. Instead, he started to work around his hearing loss, attempting to "hear" the music in any way he could. 

At first, he avoided notes with high frequencies, used whatever workarounds he could. However, once he became completely deaf, his music only lived inside his head, his imagination, he could not hear what he was playing. He cut the legs off his piano so that he could feel the vibrations of the notes he was playing. Beethoven wanted to ensure that the notes he wrote on paper "sounded" the same as they did in his head.

Beethoven composed his best string quartet when he was completely deaf. No you did not read that wrong. Beethoven composed his BEST music when he was completely deaf. Yes, I know you may think it is ironic, but I do not think so.

As Beethoven's hearing ability deteriorated, his musical intelligence increased. As Beethoven lost his hearing, he not only lost the ability to hear his own compositions, but he could not hear any other compositions; he only source of inspiration for his composition was his imagination.

Beethoven's early works were drawn from his instructor Josef Haydn. However, his later works were so distinct, so original that he became known as the father of musicâ€™s romantic period. It was only after Beethoven lost his hearing that he was able to explore his imagination and create music that he through was the best.

# Major Lessons
The Major Lessons to come from this are:
1. Losing Something should not hold you back
2. Ignore the Haters

### Losing Something should not hold you back
I am not a musician, but losing your hearing as a musician would likely be one of the worst things that could happen to anyone, but especially to a musician. Beethoven was initially depressed when he began to lose his hearing, however, he preserved and became even better composer than when he had his hearing.

### Ignore the Haters
Do to Beethoven losing his hearing, he not only could not listen to his own compositions, he could not hear other compositions. Additionally, he was able to just focus on his craft, coming up with original compositions. However, I would imagine that many people doubted Beethoven's abilities as a composer, and likely had many people rooting against him. Beethoven (unintentionally) tuned out the haters, and simply worked on perfecting his craft.

Another great example of someone who ignored the haters is Brian Armstrong, the co-founder and CEO of Coinbase, one of most popular apps to buy cryptocurrencies ([here](https://www.coinbase.com/join/baveja_p) is my referral link if you want to sign up!). In 2012, Brian [posted](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3754664) on Hacker News (basically a Reddit for startups) was looking for a co-founder for Coinbase, (at the time it was called BitBank), and he received many comments stating his idea was terrible, or that it would fail:

Here are a couple:

Brian ignored the haters and working tirelessly on Coinbase. The hardwork paid off, Coinbase is one of the most well know apps used to buy crypto. Last week, on April 14th, Coinbase went public via a direct listing.

# Conclusion
Well, thats pretty much it. I was inspired to write this article after reading this a quote about Beethoven in the Farnam Street Newsletter [Brain Food](https://fs.blog/newsletter/). I would highly recommend that you take a look at Farnam Street and their Newsletter.

PS: I am thinking of making these posts both on my site, and also in a newsletter type of thing so that people can receive them right in there inbox right away, so look for that!
