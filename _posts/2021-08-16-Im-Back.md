It has been a while since I have written any post on my website, and the main reason for that is I decided not to make posting to my personal website a priority during the school term.

I would always be caught up in doing school, or to be completely honest, just wasting time.

Well, enough, is enough, and I am going to try my best to actually put an effort into these writing. I truly do enjoy just reflecting on what I have been learning about, reading about, or kind of just putting something I find interesting on the internet.

I am going to keep this post pretty short, however, hopefully, I will be back soon with something interesting to write about.
