Heyyy or I guess Howdy!!!


I have not really kept up with making blog posts on this site! BUT during the Spring 2023 Semester at TAMU, I created a blog called [Applying Machine Learning to CyberSecurity](https://ml-to-cs.sidharthbaveja.com/) where I share my learnings from the seminars in [CSCE 689: Machine Learned Based CyberDefenses](https://marcusbotacin.github.io/teaching/ml-1). 

100% recommend taking this course if you are a student at Texas A&M. Yes it will be a lot of work, but it is worth it!!
