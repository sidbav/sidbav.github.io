Hey whoever is reading this! My name is Sidharth Baveja. 
I am currently a 4th year Electrical Engineering student at the University of Waterloo.
My interests include all things tech, crypto, investing, personal finance, and self development.

In my free time you will probably find me taking a look at [BlockFi](https://blockfi.com/?ref=552bdfc5), reading a book, or watching some Youtube videos.

I am currently looking for Fall 2021 (Sept - Dec 2021) internship opportunities so feel free to reach out to me if you got something in mind.
